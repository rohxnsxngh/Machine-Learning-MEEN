# Applying Machine Learning to Baseball

# Introduction

- More pitching technology is being introduced to the game of baseball
- Propositions have been made to replace human umpires with computers
- Some fans and players argue that automated strike zones would remove the “human element” of the game
- "If I had a choice, I would definitely say keep the human element of the game. I just enjoy that and if a guy is missing inside the plate you can use it to your advantage or maybe that's the reason why you lost.” - Mookie Betts (LA Dodgers)

# Objective 

The objective of this study is to identify and reproduce the distinct strike zones of six specific Major League Baseball umpires. The emphasis lies in the accuracy of the model to faithfully replicate the nuanced "human element" and individual tendencies exhibited by each umpire. It is crucial to note that the measure of accuracy in this context is not centered around the model's proficiency in categorizing balls and strikes correctly. Instead, the primary focus is on the model's capacity to emulate the idiosyncrasies and behaviors unique to each umpire, thereby capturing the intricacies associated with their strike zone calls.

# Strategies

developed a Python script leveraging machine learning to analyze and predict baseball umpire calls. The script employs a RandomForestClassifier to discern patterns in umpire decision-making based on pitch location. It involves data loading, preprocessing, segregation by umpire, and visualization. The machine learning techniques include data normalization, train-test split, and decision boundary visualization. While the script is optimized, potential enhancements like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis were identified. These techniques were applied to six different major league umpires.

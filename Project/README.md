# Applying Machine Learning to Baseball
- More pitching technology is being introduced to the game of baseball
- Propositions have been made to replace human umpires with computers
- Some fans and players argue that automated strike zones would remove the “human element” of the game
- "If I had a choice, I would definitely say keep the human element of the game. I just enjoy that and if a guy is missing inside the plate you can use it to your advantage or maybe that's the reason why you lost.” - Mookie Betts (LA Dodgers)

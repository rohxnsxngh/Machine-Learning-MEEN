# Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers

- Distinguish between different types of machine learning problems (e.g., classification vs. regression; supervised vs. unsupervised vs. reinforcement learning)
- Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your problem
- Gather and preprocess data appropriately for various machine learning algorithms (e.g., data cleansing, scaling/normalization, dimension reduction, encoding discrete variables)
- Apply machine learning algorithms using widely-available Python libraries 
- Validate and test a learned model (e.g., holdout vs. cross validation, avoiding pitfalls such as peeking and leaking)
- Use the output of machine learning algorithms to inform decisions in the context of mechanical system analysis and design
